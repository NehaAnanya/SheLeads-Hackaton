She Leads – Frontend Web Design

Hi there!  
Welcome to the frontend repository for **She Leads** – a web app we built during the **She Leads Hackathon**. This project is all about helping women and career seekers grow, connect, and shine in their professional journeys.

What is She Leads?

**She Leads** is more than just a website – it's a career companion.  
We designed it to be a **go-to platform** where users can:
- Stay updated with career news and job opportunities
- Easily **generate professional resumes**
-  Connect with others in their field
-  Chat with our helpful AI assistant (we call it **V-Chat**) to get answers and career guidance anytime

Our goal? To make the career journey a little less overwhelming and a lot more empowering.

What’s Inside This Repo?

This repository contains the **frontend code** that powers the She Leads platform. We focused on creating a clean, responsive, and easy-to-use interface so users feel welcome the moment they land on the site.

Built Using:
- **HTML5**, **CSS3**, and **JavaScript**
- Frameworks like **React** *(if you're using it)* or just clean vanilla JS
- UI styling with **Tailwind CSS** or **Bootstrap**
- Optionally designed with **Figma** for layout & user flow

Features You'll See:
- A neat **landing page**
- Pages for:
  - Resume builder
  - Career news
  - Community connections
  - V-Chat (our chatbot)
- A consistent and friendly **UI theme** (with green tones to keep it fresh )
